== Description ==
= PLUGIN DEPRECIATED =
Now, we are finally convinced that GOOGLE ANALYTICS stats and tracking systems are uncomparably superior (which also comes as other plugins, i.e. we like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/">Google Analytics [by MonsterInsights]</a>) over useless "POST-VIEWS" plugins, because these drawbacks:
- There are tons of bots, crawlers, search or aggregation engines, that view your websites and pages daily, and "view your posts". That ends up in fake/boosted "Post views" dramatically.
<strong>Beside bots, many people just ...:<strong>
- people open the pages in the background and close them without reading at all
- open the pages, but close while site is still loading
- open the pages, but close quickly, under 1-2 seconds, without reading your pages..
- and many other reasons.

All these actions still increases the <strong>Post-views</strong> counter. <strong>So, to say decisively, such numbers are not of any real help, instead they just mislead site-owners and their decisions.</strong>.

== ... What is solution? ==
We praise Google Analytics (or alike) tracking systems. <strong>This is what they are made for !</strong> This is the field, where they know what to do. Just state-of-the-art. They give you statistics not only of page-views, average duration (seconds), Realtime , but other tons of statisctis, which gives you <strong>realistic information about your posts and website</strong>, to make correct decisions.

YOU WILL NOT REGRET.

Just spend 2 minute to sign up for Google Analytics, get the code and use "Google Analytics" plugin.
